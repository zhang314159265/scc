# Build LLVM
```
cd $llvm_root
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm
time make -j
```

It maybe handy to have an opt build alongside the debug build. Replace 'Debug' to 'Release' in the command above for a release build.

To use the clang built from source, I need the following extra flags to find the standard headers and libraries:
1. Add extra path to search for headers: ` -I/Applications/Xcode_13.4.0_fb.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/ -I/Applications/Xcode_13.4.0_fb.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/v1 `
2. Add extra path to search for libraries: ` -Wl,-syslibroot /Applications/Xcode_13.4.0_fb.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -L/usr/local/lib `

These flags are found by running the stock clang/clang++
